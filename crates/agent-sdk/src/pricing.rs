//! static [`model_capabilities`](crate::model_capabilities) table compiled
//! into the binary: a model that table has never heard of estimates to `None`
//! ("cost unknown"), accrues nothing, and can never trip the limit.
//!
//! A [`CostEstimator`] plugs a richer pricing source in front of that table.
//! Wire one in with
//! [`AgentLoopBuilder::cost_estimator`](crate::AgentLoopBuilder::cost_estimator).
//! The loop asks the estimator about every key the call could be filed under
//! before it asks the static table about any of them, so a fresher feed price
//! wins over a compiled-in rate even for a model both sources know.
//!
//! The `model-discovery` feature implements the trait for
//! [`ModelRegistry`](agent_sdk_providers::ModelRegistry), the layered catalog,
//! so a run can price — and budget — models whose pricing only ever appeared
//! in a feed.
